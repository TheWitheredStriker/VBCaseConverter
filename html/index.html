			<h1>VBCaseConverter</h1>

			<p> 
				
				Are you a rebel like me and do you prefer writing Visual Basic keywords in lowercase &mdash; as in most
				modern programming languages &mdash; rather than making their first letter a capital? 
				(E. g. "public overrides sub" instead of "Public Overrides Sub") 
			
				<br />

				<br />

				Maybe you far prefer the way such VB code looks. Maybe you have an easier time reading the code like that,
				due to the capitalized keywords distracting you. Maybe they're even a strain on your eyes. That, or you're
				just a rebel. Or, you're like me and all four apply! Well, worry not, glorious code guru, for this converter
				will answer all of your needs. Having to manually convert every keyword in Visual Studio (or either using
				multiple carets or using the Find-and-Replace-All tool &mdash; both of which are still time-consuming) is
				now a relic of the past!

				<br />

				<br />

				Support is currently provided for:

				<ul>
					<li>Visual Basic .NET</li>
					<li>Classic Visual Basic (1993 - 2008, ending with VB6)</li>
					<li>Visual Basic for Applications</li>
					<li>VBScript</li>
					<li>Small Basic</li>
				</ul>
